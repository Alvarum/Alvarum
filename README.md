I'm a **backend developer** who enjoys solving challenges.  
I work primarily with **Python**, **networking**, and **server-side applications**.  

In addition, I create music with **Ruby**, whip up some glitch art with **Java**,  
and develop delightful little experiences for dusty vintage consoles and itch.io using a variety of techniques.  

Feel free to reach out for **collaboration** or if you just want to chat about tech, retro games, generative art/music, or the magic of code!
