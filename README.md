I'm a **backend developer** who enjoys solving challenges.
I work primarily with **Python**, **networking**, and **server-side applications**.  

In addition, I create music with **Ruby** (Sonic Pi), some generative art with **Java** (Processing),  
and develop little experiences for dusty vintage consoles and itch.io using a variety of techniques.  

Feel free to reach out for **collaboration** or if you just want to chat about tech, retro stuff, generative art/music or code!
