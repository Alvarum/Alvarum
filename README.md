I'm a **backend developer** passionate about solving challenges. I work primarily with **Python**, **networking**, and **server-side applications**. Always excited to take on new technical challenges and push the boundaries of what I can create.
Feel free to reach out for **collaboration** or if you'd like to learn more about my work!
